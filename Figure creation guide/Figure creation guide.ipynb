    "# Purpose and scope\n",
    "This notebook will tell you how to set up and use [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) together with [TikZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGF/TikZ) (requires LaTeX installation) to create publication ready figures.  \n",
    "You will learn to:\n",
    "1. define a matplotlib style sheet for ensuring that all figure panels follow the same style (font sizes, line widths, markers, etc.), \n",
    "1. create a python module with functions for creating matplotlib figures and axes of a specific size, \n",
    "1. use the module to create and store figure panels in (preferably) vectorized formats (e.g. pdf),\n",
    "1. combine individual figure panels into a complete figure using TikZ.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a complete figure usually requires two softwares\n",
    "A complete figure usually consist of multiple figure panels (the elements normally labeled a, b, c, ...) and possible additional graphical elements. The most common panel type in scientific articles and reports is the data panel (2D or 3D), that is, various types of graphs and charts, but illustrations are also common examples. \n",
    "\n",
    "Data panels are typically created using the same tools used for analyzing the data, for example, python or Matlab. However, these tools are not well suited for producing general graphical content, nor are they very good at combining multiple panels into a complete figure (unless it is a simple figure containing only data panels). You therefore need to master at least one additional software to produce more general graphical content. Free examples of such softwares include [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org) and [TikZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGF/TikZ), while commercial software examples are Photoshop and PainShop Pro. \n",
    "\n",
    "As outlined above, this guide will focus on python (using matplotlib) and TikZ. The reasons being that 1) these are free, 2) they are text (code) based and thus fully compatible with Git, and 3) they don't require a graphical user interface, meaning that complete figures can be created from scratch using terminal commands only. Taken together, these benefits let you keep everything needed for analyzing your data and for producing the figures in your publication in one git repository, and all commands needed for analyzing and generating your figures can be collected in one script. Thus, making it very easy to comply with open access policies as anybody can reproduce your publication figures once the repository is made public and assuming that the raw data can be shared through, for example, [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Before getting started\n",
    "Before even trying to create a nice publication ready figure you need to think through what you want to plot and how. The two most important questions are:\n",
    "1. The overall layout of your figure, that is, how many figure panels do you want to include and how should they roughly be organized?\n",
    "1. How much space do you have at your disposal, or how large do you want the figure to be?\n",
    "\n",
    "You should always create the figure to be of the correct size right away. If you start resizing it later, you are very likely to loose track of the final font sizes and line widths, with the end result being that your figures or figure panels don't look like they belong together. As a general starting point, you can assume that a figure intended to cover the full width of an A4 paper should be 16 to 18 cm wide, and roughly half that for a figure covering the full width of one column in a two-column format.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this guide, we will aim to create a figure about interpolation techniques (linear vs. cubic). Imagine two smaller data panels for showing a linear and a cubic function, and one large panel for illustrating the difference between linear and cubic interpolation. The complete figure should match the text width in an A4 paper and we thus aim for a figure width of roughly 16 cm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preparing directories for files to be created\n",
    "This notebook will produce several files and we will therefore add a couple of directories to store things in (unless they already exist)."

    "# Additional suggestions for larger projects\n",

    "1. Turn the code that produces each matplotlib panel into functions, and create a script that updates all figures in one go.\n",
    "1. Move all additional plotting parameters (parameters not included in the style sheet), such as the figure size, the plotting regions, and project specific colors to a separate configuration file (or somewhere else where it can be accessed by all panel plotting functions).\n",
    "\n",
    "The underlying idea being that you should be able to update for example the size of all panels belonging to one particular figure, whenever you decide to change the size of the whole figure. Ideally, you should accomplish this by only changing the figure size in a configuration file, and then running a script that 1) calls all functions responsible for plotting the panels, and 2) runs pdflatex to assemble the updated panels using TikZ.\n",
    "\n",
    "At first sight, it might feel like an overkill to put this much emphasis on being able to easily update all the figures in your publication. However, during the final stages of any project, there always tends to be numerous fine-tunings of data preprocessing, data analysis, and also the figures themselves. Thus, making sure that all your figures are easily updated will save a lot of time in the end."
