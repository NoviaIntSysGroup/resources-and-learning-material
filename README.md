# resources-and-learning-material

This repository is intended to help you get up and running with machine learning projects. The most commonly used programing language for machine learning is python, and the default tool is [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org). The easiest way to get Jupyter Notebook running on your own computer is to install it using Anaconda (see installation instruction below). Alternatively, you can use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) which is Jupyter Notebook run on Google's servers and accessed through your browser. Colab is an excellent choice if you don't have a GPU but want to test models that require one, as google will give you GPU access for free through Colab. 

The repository contains:
1. [Instructions](Installation_And_Configuration.md) for how to get essential software installed (e.g. Git and Anaconda).
1. A collection of links to good [study material](Study_Material.md).
1. A collection of interactive demos for understanding fundamental concepts and methods.
