# resources-and-learning-material
This repository is intended to help you get up and running with machine learning projects. The repository contains:
1. A description of the workflow and project structure we use in our projects.
1. [Instructions](Installation_And_Configuration.md) for how to get essential software installed (e.g. Git and Anaconda).
1. A collection of links to good [study material](Study_Material.md).
1. Interactive demos for understanding fundamental concepts and methods.
1. Notebooks with guides and tutorials on various relevant topics.

## Quick start to get up and running right away
The most commonly used programing language for machine learning is python, and the default tool are Jupyter like [Notebook](https://jupyter.org). The easiest way to get Jupyter Notebook running on your own computer is to install it using Anaconda (see the installation [instruction](Installation_And_Configuration.md)). An even faster and simpler approach is to use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com), which essentially is Jupyter Notebook run on Google's servers and accessed through your browser. Colab is an excellent choice to get started right away (requires a Google account though), and in addition, Google will even provide you with limited but free GPU access if needed.
