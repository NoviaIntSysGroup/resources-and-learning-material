## Fundamental math and engineering topics
3Blue1Brown publishes excellent videos describing various math related topics in ways that text books can't. The following playlists should be considered essential for any engineer.
* [Essence of Linear Algebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab)  
* [Essence of Calculus](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr)  
* [Differential equations](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNPOjrT6KVlfJuKtYTftqH6)  
* [Neural networks](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi)  

Always check for separate videos when trying to understand a new math related topic such as Fourier or Laplace transforms. Great youtube channels for this purpose are:
* [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown/featured)  
* [Zach Star](https://www.youtube.com/c/zachstar/videos)

Videos is not always enough but there are courses available where you can get "Real" hands-on experience to better grasp the topics at the cost of investing some more time. Two examples are:
* [Khan Academy (Free)](https://www.khanacademy.org)
* [Brilliant (Yearly subscription)](https://brilliant.org/premium/)

In you want to read books, then [Steven Strogatz's](https://www.stevenstrogatz.com/all-books) books is a place to start. His book *Nonlinear dynamics and chaos* is often used as a standard text book in dynamical systems courses. And the book *Infinite powers* gives a nice view on calculus by explaining the core ideas in their historical context.

## Machine learning and computer science
[Kaggle provides free courses](https://www.kaggle.com/learn) with an emphasis on getting started with machine learning right now using jupyter notebooks. In addition, Kaggle run machine learning competitions on published datasets, and their code and discussion section often contain jupyter notebooks with relevant material for specific problems.

Google research extended the standard jupyter notebook into [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com), which let you run notebooks directly in your browser without having to install anything on your computer (Colab notebooks gets stored on google drive). To support your learning, there is a vast collection of notebooks freely available on the [AI hub](https://aihub.cloud.google.com/s?category=notebook) covering a wide range of AI and machine learning topics. [Google AI](https://ai.google/education/) similarly publishes a lot of free useful guides, interactive material as well as courses: A few good examples are:
* [Machine learning courses](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course)
* [People + AI Guidebook](https://pair.withgoogle.com/guidebook)  
* [Deep playground](http://playground.tensorflow.org/#activation=tanh&batchSize=10&dataset=circle&regDataset=reg-plane&learningRate=0.03&regularizationRate=0&noise=0&networkShape=4,2&seed=0.78842&showTestData=false&discretize=false&percTrainData=50&x=true&y=true&xTimesY=false&xSquared=false&ySquared=false&cosX=false&sinX=false&cosY=false&sinY=false&collectStats=false&problem=classification&initZero=false&hideText=false)

**Genre specific material**
- Deep learning (FastAI): Free [MOOC](https://course.fast.ai) with a course book published as [Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook).
- Deep learning (free course from MIT): [Introduction to Deep Learning MIT 6.S191](http://introtodeeplearning.com/)

**Datasets**  
You can find datasets to practice on from:
* [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
* [Google Dataset Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com)

## Physics
A lot of the concepts and ideas used in machine learning have originated from physics. At times, it can therefore be quite helpful to get an understanding of the problems they initially tried to solve as well as the underlying reasoning. [The theoretical minimun series by Leonard Susskind](https://theoreticalminimum.com/courses) is the best resource that I have found for achieving this. The first three courses *Classical Mechanics*, *Quantum mechanics*, and *Special Relativity and Classical Field Theory* are also available as books written in a easily readable way.
